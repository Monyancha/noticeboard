#USIU Notice Board

####Idea

Not many people really take time to read the various notice boards on campus. Often, they contain timely and urgent information that many miss because they didn’t pass near a notice board, could not read the small black font on the bright white paper or simply because the information was buried under a tonne of other “non-important” information.

We would like to change that by supplementing and eventually replacing the physical notice boards with a mobile app. Because we carry our phones everywhere and rarely turn them off, a mobile app that presents the notice board’s information in a very efficient way would prevent students from missing those important alerts, messages or sign up sheets on the notice board.

####Features

The app would allow students to:
- View messages, announcements and alerts.
- View Sign-up sheets.
- View Schedules and timetables and all kinds of information usually posted on notice boards.
- Receive notification of new content via push notification or SMS

The school staff will post board information on a web **dashboard**. Alternatively, staff could post content on the school website. Because the school is currently using Joomla as it’s content management system for the main site (*www.usiu.ac.ke*), integration with our app would be very easy because nothing more than content needs to be added to the site. Our app would pull said as **RSS feeds**, a feature already available on the site.

Instant notifications will be served by a web backend to our app. This simple web service would regularly check the feeds and send notifications to the app if new content is available.

In short, with this project, we intend to substitute the school’s notice boards with a system comprising of a mobile app, a web service (app marketing & backend api, staff dashboard) and, optionally, the school’s content management system.
